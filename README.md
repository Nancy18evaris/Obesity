OBESITY LEVEL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.This project uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict obesity levels based on eating habits, physical condition, and lifestyle factors. It includes 2,111 records from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, and is ideal for exploring classification models in healthcare.

DATASET HIGHLIGHTS
16 input features: Age, gender, diet, physical activity, water intake, etc.
